## Context
First year school project. Goal is to add a new feature to an algorithm that forecast development of hydrogen technologies in the RÃ©gion Sud (France).
Given that the algo currently only work on a single city, the feature consists of implementing transport technologies and 
multinode optimization in order to take multiple cities into consideration.

The major update in the optimization scheme is the shift from Linear programming to Integer-Linear programming.
